# Easy Cipher Content

A VS Code extension for encrypting and decrypting both text and binary files with AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithms.

## Features

- üîí **Encrypt** and üîì **Decrypt** text content line by line or entire files
- üñºÔ∏è Support for both text files and binary files (images, videos, etc.)
- üóÑÔ∏è Batch encryption/decryption of an entire workspace
- üö´ Ignore specific files/directories during batch operations
- üîë Configurable encryption algorithms and key management

## Usage

### Single File Operations

- Click the üîí **Encrypt** or üîì **Decrypt** buttons in the editor title bar
- For text files, content is encrypted line by line
- For binary files, the entire file is encrypted and saved with a `.enc` extension

### Workspace Operations

1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) to open the Command Palette
2. Type "Encrypt All Files in Workspace" or "Decrypt All Files in Workspace"
3. The extension will process all files according to your configuration

### Ignoring Files

Create a `.easy-cipher-content-ignore` file in your workspace root with patterns similar to `.gitignore`:

## Configuration

This extension supports the following settings:

* `easy-cipher-content.algorithm`: Choose encryption algorithm ("aes-gcm" or "chacha20-poly1305")
* `easy-cipher-content.use_env`: Whether to use environment variables for encryption keys
* `easy-cipher-content.json_path`: Path to JSON file containing encryption keys (if not using env vars)

### Environment Variables

When using environment variables (`use_env` = `true`):

For AES-GCM:
- VSCODE_EXT_ECC_AESGCM_PASSWORD
- VSCODE_EXT_ECC_AESGCM_SALT
- VSCODE_EXT_ECC_AESGCM_IV

For ChaCha20-Poly1305:
- VSCODE_EXT_ECC_CHACHA20POLY1305_PASSWORD
- VSCODE_EXT_ECC_CHACHA20POLY1305_SALT
- VSCODE_EXT_ECC_CHACHA20POLY1305_NONCE

### JSON Configuration

When using JSON config (`use_env` = `false`), create a JSON file with:
```json
// aes-gcm
{
  "password": "your_password",
  "salt": "your_salt",
  "iv": "your_iv"
}

// chacha20-poly1305
{
  "password": "your_password",
  "salt": "your_salt",
  "nonce": "your_nonce"
}
```
